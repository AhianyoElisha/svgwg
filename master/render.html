<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Implementations of SVG are expected to behave as though they
implement a rendering (or imaging) model corresponding to the
one described in this chapter.
</p>

<p>The appendix on <a href="conform.html">conformance
requirements</a> describes the extent to which an actual
implementation may deviate from this description. In practice
an actual implementation <span class="ready-for-wider-review">may</span>
deviate slightly because of
limitations of the output device (e.g. only a limited range of
colors might be supported) and because of practical limitations
in implementing a precise mathematical model (e.g. for
realistic performance curves are approximated by straight
lines, the approximation need only be sufficiently precise to
match the conformance requirements).</p>
    

<div class='ready-for-wg-review'>
<h2 id="RenderingTree">The rendering tree</h2>
    
<p> The components of the final rendered representation of an SVG document
    do not have a one-to-one relationship with the underlying 
    elements in the document model.
    The appearance of the graphic instead reflects a parallel structure,
    the rendering tree,
    in which some elements are excluded and others are repeated.
</p>
    
<p> Many elements in the SVG namespace do not directly represent 
    a component of the graphical document.  
    Instead, they define graphical effects, metadata,
    content to be used to represent other elements,
    or alternatives to be displayed under certain conditions.
    In dynamic documents, certain components of the graphic
    may be rendered or not, depending on interaction or animation.
    These non-rendered elements are not directly included
    in the <a>rendering tree</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Because SVG supports the reuse of graphical sub-components,
    some elements are rendered multiple times.
    The individual renderings may have context-dependent styling
    and may be rasterized at different scales or transformations.
    However, they are always reflections of the original element,
    and are not directly manipulable by script or user interaction.

</dl>
    
<h3 id="Rendered-vs-NonRendered">Rendered versus non-rendered elements</h3>
    
<p> The elements in an SVG document are each either 
    rendered or non-rendered at a given point in time.
    Whether an element is currently rendered or not affects
    not only its visual display but also interactivity
    and geometric calculations.
</p>
    
<p>
    An element is <em>not rendered</em> in any of these four situations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a>never-rendered element</a> types</li>
    <li>elements excluded because of <a>conditional processing attributes</a> 
        or <a>'switch'</a> structures
    </li>
    <li>elements with a computed style value of <code>none</code>
        for the <a>'display'</a> property
    </li>
    <li>descendent elements of other non-rendered elements
    </li>
</ul>
    
<p> Non-rendered elements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>have no visual effect on the graphic,
      except when they are used in the rendering of another element 
      that references them.</li>

  <li>do not contribute to the net geometry of 
      <a>clipping paths</a> or <a>masks</a> 
      when they are descendants of a
      <a>'clipPath'</a> or <a>'mask element'</a> </li>

  <li>are not sensitive to <a href="interact.html#UIEvents">pointer events</a></li>
    
  <li>cannot receive <a>focus</a></li>

  <li>do not contribute to <a href="coords.html#ObjectBoundingBox">bounding box
  calculations</a></li>

  <li>are not considered when performing <a href="text.html#TextLayout">text layout</a></li>
</ul>
    
<p> Non-rendered elements likewise have no counterpart 
    in an accessible alternative view of the document.
    Nonetheless, they remain part of the document model, and
    participate in <a href="styling.html">style inheritance and cascade</a>.
</p>
    
    
<h3 id="VisibilityControl">Controlling visibility: the effect of the <span
class="property">'display'</span> and <span class="property">'visibility'</span>
properties</h3>
    
<p>
    SVG uses two properties to toggle the visible display of
    elements that are normally rendered:
    <a>'display'</a> and <a>'visibility'</a>.
    Although they have a similar visible effect in static documents,
    they are conceptually distinct.
</p>

<p class="note">See the CSS 2.1 specification for the definitions
of <a>'display'</a> and <a>'visibility'</a>.
[<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS21">CSS21</a>]</p>
    
<p>
    Setting  <a>'display'</a> to <span class="prop-value">none</span> 
    results in the element not being rendered.
    When applied to 
    <a>graphics elements</a>,
    <a>text content elements</a>,
    and <a>container elements</a> that are normally rendered,
    setting <a>'display'</a> to <span class="prop-value">none</span> 
    results in the element (and all its descendents) 
    not becoming part of the <a>rendering tree</a>. 
    Note that <a>'display'</a> is not an inherited property.
</p>
<p>
    Elements that have any other <a>'display'</a> value than
<span class="prop-value">none</span> are rendered as normal.
</p>
<p>
    The <a>'display'</a> property only applies to <a>renderable elements</a>.
    Setting <code>display: none</code> on an element
    that is <a>never directly rendered</a>
    or <a>not rendered</a> based on conditional processing
    has no effect.
</p>

<p>
    The <a>'display'</a> property affects the direct processing
    of a given element, but it does not prevent it from
    being referenced by other elements. 
    For example, setting
    <span class="prop-value">display: none</span> on a <a>'path'</a> element
    will prevent that element from getting rendered directly onto the
    canvas, but the <a>'path'</a> element can still be referenced by a
    <a>'textPath'</a> element and its geometry will be used
    in text-on-a-path processing.
</p>

<p>
    When applied to a <a>graphics element</a> or <a>text content element</a>,
    setting <a>'visibility'</a> to <span class="prop-value">hidden</span>
    or <span class="prop-value">collapse</span>
    results in the element not being painted.  
    It is, however, still part of the <a>rendering tree</a>. 
    It may be sensitive to pointer events 
    (depending on the value of <a>'pointer-events'</a>),
    may receive focus (depending on the value of <a>'tabindex'</a>),
    contributes to bounding box calculations and clipping paths,
    and does affect text layout.
</p>

<p>
    The <a>'visibility'</a> property only directly applies to
    <a>graphics elements</a> and <a>text content elements</a>.
    Since <a>'visibility'</a> is an inherited property, however,
    although it has no effect on a <a>container element</a> itself,
    its inherited value can affect descendant elements.
</p>
    
<h3 id="ReusedGraphics">Re-used graphics</h3>
    
<p> Graphical content defined in one part of the document
    (or in another document)
    may be used to render other elements.
    This includes the graphics created by style properties
    (such as a <a>'pattern'</a> paint server, or line <a>markers</a>)
    as well as graphics that are instantiated with a <a>'use'</a> element.
    In the case of <a>'use'</a> instances,
    the original graphical elements may or may not be rendered themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Each instance of the re-used graphics creates a fragment of the <a>rendering tree</a>.
    The component graphics may need their styles resolved based on context,
    then they are rendered and composited as described in this chapter.
    The re-used fragment as a whole is treated as a <a>stacking context</a>
    and a <a>non-isolated group</a>.
</p>
<p> 
    The <a>'display'</a> property on any child content of re-used graphics
    has its normal effect when set to <code>none</code>,
    preventing that branch of the document fragment from being used in rendering.
    Similarly, when a <a>'use'</a> element references a
    <a>renderable element</a> (as opposed to a <a>'symbol'</a>),
    a value of <code>display: none</code> on the referenced element
    will result in an empty rendering-tree fragment for that 'use' element.
    However, re-used graphics are never affected
    when the original DOM elements themselves are not rendered
    because of a value of <code>display: none</code> on an ancestor.
</p>

<div class="ready-for-wider-review">

<h2 id="PaintersModel">The painters model</h2>

<p>SVG uses a "painters model" of rendering. <a>Paint</a>
is applied in successive operations to the output device such
that each operation paints onto some area of the output device,
possibly obscuring paint that has previously been layed down.

After each object or group is painted, it becomes part of the background
for the next painting operation.

SVG 2 supports advanced blending modes and compositing operations that
control how each painting operation interacts with the background.
The rules governing these painting operations are outlined in the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/compositing/">Compositing and Blending Specification</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="RenderingOrder">Rendering order</h2>
<p>Elements in SVG are positioned in three dimensions. In addition to their
position on the x and y axis of the <a>SVG viewport</a>, SVG elements are also
positioned on the z axis. The position on the z-axis defines the order that 
they are painted.</p>

<p>Along the z axis, elements are grouped into <dfn id="TermStackingContext">stacking contexts</dfn>, each stacking
context has an associated stack level.
A stack level may contain one or more child nodes - either child
stack levels, <a>graphics elements</a>, or <a>'g'</a> elements.
<a>Graphics elements</a> and <a>'g'</a> elements within single
stack level are painted in document order - that is, they are painted
in the order that they are defined in the document.</p>

<p>Each stack level is assigned an integer value that defines it's
position on the z axis relative to other stack levels within the same
stacking context. Lower values are painted first, and so
elements in a stack level with a higher value will paint over one 
with a lower value.</p>

<p>By default, everything is placed in stack level zero.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ZIndexProperty">Controlling element rendering order: the <span class='property'>'z-index'</span> property</h3>

<p class="note">See the CSS 2.1 specification for the definition
of <a>'z-index'</a>. [<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS21">CSS21</a>]</p>

<p>The <a>'z-index'</a> property allows an element to be assigned to a 
stack level.
</p>

<p class="ready-for-wider-review">
The rules governing behavior for SVG elements with the <a>'z-index'</a>
property specified are outlined below:
</p>

<p class="note">CSS <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-z-index">specifies</a> a
property named <a>'z-index'</a>.  The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/zindex.html">CSS rules
that define the effect of the <span class='property'>'z-index'</span> property</a>
were written specifically for the CSS box model, and those rules do not make
sense as they stand for most SVG elements (most SVG elements do not participate
in or establish a CSS box model layout).  This section specifies how
implementations must handle the <a>'z-index'</a> property on elements in the SVG
namespace.</p>

<p>Contrary to the rules in CSS 2.1, the <a>'z-index'</a> property applies to all SVG
elements regardless of the value of the <a>'position'</a> property, with one exception:
as for boxes in CSS 2.1, outer <a>'svg'</a> elements must be positioned for <a>'z-index'</a>
to apply to them.</p>

<p>The <a>'z-index'</a> property specifies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The stack level of the element in the current stacking context.</li>
  <li>Whether the element establishes a new local stacking context.</li>
</ol>

<p>Values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>&lt;integer&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This integer is the stack level of the element in the current
  stacking context. The element also establishes a new local
  stacking context for its descendants.</dd>

  <dt>auto</dt>
  <dd>The stack level of the element in the current stacking context
  is the same as its parent element, unless its parent established
  a new stacking context, in which case its stack level is 0. The
  element does not establish a new local stacking context.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="example">
  <p>Here is a simple example:</p>
  <pre>&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
  &lt;rect x="0"  width="100" height="100" style="fill: red;    z-index: -1;"/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="40" width="100" height="100" style="fill: lime;"/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="80" width="100" height="100" style="fill: blue;   z-index: 1;/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="60" width="100" height="100" style="fill: aqua;"/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="20" width="100" height="100" style="fill: yellow; z-index: -1;"/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre>
  <p>In this example there are three stack levels: -1, 0 (the default) and 1. The red
  and yellow rects are in stack level -1, the lime and aqua rects are in stack
  level 0 (the default), and the blue rect is in stack level 1. Going from lowest
  stack level to highest, and painting the elements in each stack level in
  document order, the painting order is: red, yellow, lime, aqua, blue.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="EstablishingStackingContex">Establishing a stacking context in SVG</h3>
<p>A new stacking context must be established at an SVG element for its descendants if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is the root element</li>

  <li>the <a>'z-index'</a> property applies to the element and its computed

<!--
<p>For a user friendly explanation of the terms "stack level" and "stacking
context", see the z-index primer document. For the normative rules regarding how
stacking contexts and stack levels affect SVG elements, see below.</p>
-->

<p>Stacking contexts and stack levels are conceptual tools used to describe the
order in which elements must be painted one on top of the other when the
document is rendered, and for determining which element is highest when
determining the target of a pointer event. Stacking contexts and stack levels do
not affect the position of elements in the DOM tree, and their presence or
absence does not affect an element's position, size or orientation in the
canvas' X-Y plane - only the order in which it is painted.</p>

<p>Stacking contexts can contain further stacking contexts. A stacking context is
atomic from the point of view of its parent stacking context; elements in
ancestor stacking contexts may not come between any of its elements.</p>

<p>Each element belongs to one stacking context. Each element in a given stacking
context has an integer stack level. Elements with a higher stack level must be
placed in front of elements with lower stack levels in the same stacking
context. Elements may have negative stack levels. Elements with the same stack
level in a stacking context must be stacked according to document order.</p>

<p>With the exception of the <a>'foreignObject'</a> element, the back to front
stacking order for a stacking context created by an SVG element is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the background and borders of the element forming the stacking
  context, if any</li>

  <li>child stacking contexts created by descendants with negative stack
  levels, primarily ordered by most negative first, then by tree order</li>

  <li>descendants with <span class='prop-value'>'z-index: auto'</span> or
  <span class='prop-value'>'z-index: 0'</span>, in tree order</li>

  <li>child stacking contexts created by descendants with positive stack levels,
  primarily ordered by lowest index first, then by tree order</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the <a>'foreignObject'</a> element creates a "fixed position containing block" in
CSS terms, the normative rules for the stacking order of the stacking context
created by <a>'foreignObject'</a> elements are the rules in Appendix E of CSS 2.1.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>In the following example, the <a>'z-index'</a> property on the <a>'g'</a>
  element is set to zero. This creates a new stacking context to contain the
  <a>'g'</a> element's children without moving the <a>'g'</a> to a different
  level in the document's root stacking context:</p>
  <pre>&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
  &lt;g style="z-index: 0;"&gt;
    &lt;!-- this is a self contained graphic --&gt;
    &lt;rect x="40" width="100" height="100" style="fill: lime; z-index: 1;"/&gt;
    &lt;rect x="20" width="100" height="100" style="fill: yellow;"/&gt;
  &lt;/g&gt;
  &lt;rect x="60" width="100" height="100" style="fill: aqua;"/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="0" width="100" height="100" style="fill: red; z-index: -1;"/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre>

  <p>The example's root stacking context contains two stack levels: -1 and 0. The red
  <a>'rect'</a> is in level -1, and the <a>'g'</a> element and aqua <a>'rect'</a> are in level 0. Inside
  stack level 0, the <a>'g'</a> element's <a>'z-index'</a> property creates a new nested stacking
  context at the <a>'g'</a> for the <a>'g'</a> element's children. In this child stacking
  context there are two stack levels: 0 and 1. The yellow <a>'rect'</a> is in level 0 (the
  default), and the lime <a>'rect'</a> is in level 1.</p>

  <p>Painting of this example starts with the stack levels of the root stacking
  context. First the red rect is painted in level -1, then in level 0 the <a>'g'</a>
  element is painted followed by the aqua rect. When the <a>'g'</a> element is painted,
  the child stacking context that its z-index created and all of that context's
  stack levels are also painted. In this child stacking context, first the yellow
  rect in level 0 is painted, followed by the lime rect in level 1. It's only
  after the <a>'g'</a> and the stacking context that it creates has been painted that the
  aqua rect is painted. Note that this means that although the z-index of 1 for
  the lime rect is a higher value than the (implicit) z-index of 0 for the aqua
  rect, the containment provided by the <a>'g'</a>'s child stacking context results in the
  aqua rect painting over the lime rect. The painting order is therefore: red,
  yellow, lime, aqua.</p>

(See  <a href="#PaintingShapesAndText">Painting shapes and text</a>) being
members of that group. See <a href="#Grouping">How groups are rendered</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Grouping">How groups are rendered</h2>
<div class="ready-for-wider-review">
</div>
<div class="ready-for-wider-review">
<p>
Grouping elements, such as the <a>'g'</a> element (see <a>container elements</a>
) create a <a>compositing group</a>. The <a>Compositing and Blending</a> 
specification normatively describes how to render <a>compositing groups</a>.
In SVG, effects may be applied to a group. For example, opacity, filters 
or masking. These effects are applied to the rendered result of the group
immediately before any transforms on the group are applied, which are applied
immediately before the group is blended and composited with the
<a>group backdrop</a>. Applying any such effects to a group makes that 
group isolated.
<br/><br/>
Thus, rendering a <a>compositing group</a> follows the following steps:<br/>
If the group is isolated:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a>initial backdrop</a> is set to a new buffer initialised with
rgba(0,0,0,0)</li>
<li>The contents of the group that are <a>graphics elements</a> or
<a>'g element'</a> elements are rendered
<a href="#RenderingOrder">in order</a>, onto the 
<a>initial backdrop</a></li>
<li>filters and other effects that modify the group canvas are applied
<div class="note">
<p class='ready-for-wg-review'>To provide for high quality rendering, filter
primitives and other bitmap effects must be applied in the
<a>operating coordinate space</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Group transforms are applied</li>
<li>The group canvas is blended and composited with the <a>group backdrop</a></li>
</ol>
else (the group is not isolated):
<ol>
<li>The <a>initial backdrop</a> is set to the <a>group backdrop</a></li>
<li>The contents of the group that are <a>graphics elements</a> or
<a>'g element'</a> elements are rendered
<a href="#RenderingOrder">in order</a>, onto the 
<a>initial backdrop</a>. The group transforms are applied to each element
as they are rendered.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 id="ObjectAndGroupOpacityProperties">Object and group opacity: the
effect of the <span class="property">'opacity'</span> property</h3>

<p class="note">See the CSS Color Module Level 3 for the definition
of <a>'opacity'</a>. [<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS3COLOR">CSS3COLOR</a>]</p>

<p>The <a>'opacity'</a> property specifies how opaque a given
graphical element or container element will be when it is
painted to the canvas.  When applied to a container element,
this is known as <em>group opacity</em>, and when applied to
an individual rendering element, it is known as <em>object
opacity</em>.  The principle for these two operations however
is the same.</p>

<p>There are several other opacity-related properties in SVG:</p>

<ul>
<li><a>'fill-opacity'</a>, which specifies the opacity of a fill
operation;</li>

<li><a>'stroke-opacity'</a>, which specifies the opacity of a stroking
operation;</li>

<li><a>'solid-opacity'</a>, which specifies the opacity of a solid color
paint server; and</li>

<li><a>'stop-opacity'</a>, which specifies the opacity of a gradient stop.</li>
</ul>

<p>These four opacity properties are involved in intermediate rendering operations.
Object and group opacity however can be thought of as a post-processing operation.
Conceptually, the object or group to which <a>'opacity'</a> applies
is rendered into an RGBA offscreen image.  The offscreen image as whole is then blended
into the canvas with the specified <a>'opacity'</a> value used uniformly
across the offscreen image.
<span class="ready-for-wider-review">
Thus, the presence of <a>'opacity property'</a> causes the group to be
<a>isolated</a>.
</span>
</p>

<p>The <a>'opacity'</a> property applies to the following SVG elements:
<a>'svg'</a>, <a>'g'</a>, <a>'symbol'</a>, <a>'marker element'</a>,
<a>'a'</a>, <a>'switch'</a>, <a>graphics elements</a> and
<a>text content child elements</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>The following example illustrates various usage of the <a>'opacity'</a>
property on objects and groups.</p>

<edit:includefile href='images/masking/opacity01.svg'/>

<div class='figure'>
<img class='bordered' src='images/masking/opacity01.svg' alt='Image showing different groups of circles blended into the background.'/>
<p class='caption'>Each group of red and green circles is first rendered
to an offscreen image before being blended with the background
blue rectangle as a whole, with the given <a>'opacity'</a> values.</p>
</div>

<p>In the example, the top row of circles have differing opacities,
ranging from 1.0 to 0.2. The bottom row illustrates five <a>'g'</a> elements,
each of which contains overlapping red and green circles, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first group shows the opaque case for reference. The group has
opacity of 1, as do the circles.</li>

<li>The second group shows group opacity when the elements in the group are
opaque.</li>

<li>The third and fourth group show that opacity is not commutative. In the
third group (which has opacity of 1), a semi-transparent green circle is
drawn on top of a semi-transparent red circle, whereas in the fourth group a
semi-transparent red circle is drawn on top of a semi-transparent green
circle. Note that area where the two circles intersect display different
colors. The third group shows more green color in the intersection area,
whereas the fourth group shows more red color.</li>

<li>The fifth group shows the multiplicative effect of opacity settings.
Both the circles and the group itself have opacity settings of .5. The
result is that the portion of the red circle which does not overlap with the
green circle (i.e., the top/right of the red circle) will blend into the
blue rectangle with accumulative opacity of .25 (i.e., .5*.5), which, after
blending into the blue rectangle, results in a blended color which is 25%
red and 75% blue.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="TypesOfGraphicsElements">Types of graphics elements</h2>

<p>SVG supports three fundamental types of <a>graphics elements</a>
that can be rendered onto the canvas:</p>

<ul>
<li><a>Shapes</a>, which represent some combination of straight line
and curves</li>
<li>Text, which represents some combination of character glyphs</li>
<li>Raster images, which represent an array of values that
specify the paint color and opacity (often termed alpha) at a
series of points on a rectangular grid. (SVG requires support
for specified raster image formats under
<a href="conform.html">conformance requirements</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="PaintingShapesAndText">Painting shapes and text</h3>

<p>Shapes and text can be <a>filled</a> (i.e., apply paint to the
interior of the shape) and <a>stroked</a> (i.e., apply paint
along the outline of the shape).</p>

<p>For certain types of shapes, <a href="painting.html#Markers">marker
symbols</a> (which themselves can consist of any combination of shapes,
text and images) can be drawn at positions along the
shape boundary. Each marker symbol
is painted as if its graphical content were expanded into the
SVG document tree just after the shape object which is using
the given marker symbol. The graphical contents of a marker
symbol are rendered using the same methods as graphics
elements. Marker symbols are not applicable to text.</p>

<p>The order in which fill, stroke and markers are painted is determined
by the <a>'paint-order'</a> property. The default is that 
fill is painted first, then the stroke, and then the
marker symbols. The marker symbols are rendered in order along
the outline of the shape, from the start of the shape to the
end of the shape.</p>

<p>Each fill and stroke operation has its own opacity settings;
thus, you can fill and/or stroke a shape with a
semi-transparently drawn solid color, with different opacity
values for the fill and stroke operations.</p>

<p>The fill and stroke operations are entirely independent
painting operations; thus, any stroke applied to the shape will be painted on
top of part of the fill.</p>

<p>SVG supports numerous built-in types of paint which can
be used in fill and stroke operations. These are described in
<a href="pservers.html">Paint Servers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="PaintingRasterImages">Painting raster images</h3>

<p>When a raster image is rendered, the original samples are
"resampled" using standard algorithms to produce samples at the
positions required on the output device. Resampling
requirements are discussed under
<a href="conform.html">conformance requirements</a>.</p>
<p class="ready-for-wider-review">
As in HTML [<a href="refs.html#ref-HTML">HTML</a>, 10.4.2], 
all animated images with the same absolute URL and the same image 
data are expected to be rendered synchronised to the same timeline as a group,
with the timeline starting at the time of the least recent addition to the 
group.
</p>
<p class="ready-for-wider-review">
When a user agent is to restart the animation for an img element showing an 
animated image, all animated images with the same absolute URL and the same 
image data in that img element's node document are expected to restart their 
animation from the beginning.
</p>

<h2 id="FilteringPaintRegions">Filtering painted regions</h2>
<p>SVG allows any painting operation to be filtered. (See
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects/">Filter Effects</a>.)</p>

<p>In this case the result must be as though the paint
operations had been applied to an intermediate canvas
initialized to transparent black, of a size determined by the
rules given in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects/">Filter Effects</a> then
filtered by the processes defined in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects/">Filter Effects</a>.</p>

<div class="ready-for-wider-review">
<h2 id="ClippingAndMasking">Clipping and masking</h2>

<p>SVG supports the following clipping/masking features:</p>

<ul>
<li>clipping paths, which either uses
any combination of <a>'path'</a>, <a>'text'</a> and
<a>basic shapes</a> or basic shapes to serve as
the outline of a (in the absence of anti-aliasing) 1-bit
mask, where everything on the "inside" of the outline is
allowed to show through but everything on the outside is
masked out</li>

<li>masks, which are
<a>container elements</a>
which can contain <a>graphics elements</a>
or other container elements which define a set of graphics
that is to be used as a semi-transparent mask for compositing
foreground objects into the current background.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both, clipping and masking, are specified in the module CSS Masking
[<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS-MASKING">CSS-MASKING</a>].</p>
</div>

<h2 id="ParentCompositing">Parent compositing</h2>
<p>SVG document fragments can be semi-opaque.</p>
<p class="ready-for-wider-review">
In accordance with the <a>Compositing and Blending</a> specification,
the <a>'svg'</a> element always creates an <a>isolated</a> group.
</p>
<p class="ready-for-wider-review">
When the SVG document is a <a>top-level document</a>, the top level SVG
element is considered to be the <a>Page Group</a> and is composited with
a backdrop of white with 100% opacity. For all other <a>referencing modes</a>,
there is no <a>Page Group</a>. The SVG document is composited into the parent
document with opacity preserved.

<p>The <a>'overflow'</a> property has the same parameter values and has the
same meaning <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/visufx.html#propdef-overflow">as defined in CSS 2.1</a>
([<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS21">CSS21</a>], section 11.1.1);
however, the following additional points apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  If the <a>'overflow'</a> property has a value of 'visible', 
  the property has no effect (i.e., a clipping rectangle is not created).
  </li>

  <li>For those elements to which the <a>'overflow'</a> property can apply. 
  If the <a>'overflow'</a> property has the value <span class='prop-value'>
  hidden</span> or <span class='prop-value'>scroll</span>, a clip,
  the exact size of the viewport is applied.
  </li>

  <li>
  When <span class='prop-value'>scroll</span> is specified on an
  <a>'svg'</a> element and if the user agent uses a scrolling mechanism that
  is visible on the screen (such as a scroll bar or a panner), that mechanism 
  should be displayed for the viewport whether or not any of its content is clipped.
  </li>

  <li>
  Within SVG content, the value <span class='prop-value'>auto</span> implies
  that all rendered content for child elements must be 
  <span class='prop-value'>visible</span>, either through a scrolling
  mechanism, or by rendering with no clip.
  For elements where the value of <span class='prop-value'>scroll</span> results
  in a scrolling mechanism being used by the user agent, then a value of
  <span class='prop-value'>auto</span> may be treated as
  <span class='prop-value'>scroll</span>. If the user agent has no scrolling
  mechanism, the content would not be clipped, or the value 'scroll' is treated
  as <span class='prop-value'>hidden</span>, then the value
  <span class='prop-value'>auto</span> must be treated as
  <span class='prop-value'>visible</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
Although the initial value for <a>'overflow'</a> is auto. In the UA style sheet,
overflow is overriden for the <a>'svg'</a> element when it is not the root
element of a stand-alone document, the <a>'pattern'</a> element, <a>'hatch'</a>
element, and the <a>'marker element'</a> element to be hidden by default.
